        <h5>
            Highway authorities in the UK are responsible for maintaining 1000's of km of paved carriageway and footway.
            Both reactive maintenance proactive resurfacing are expensive and mistakes cost <b>time</b> and <b>money</b>.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Quartic integrates <b>asset databases</b> (e.g. Pitney Bowes Confirm), <b>visual and digital inspection data</b> (HMDIF)
            and ad-hoc spreadsheets to give a single <b>unified</b> picture of road condition and maintenance work.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Our road-specific insights use all available data to accurately model <b>deterioration</b> and suggest <b>optimal</b>
            maintenance and treatment strategies. For example, we are able to spot opportunities for <b>targeted resurfacing</b> leading to considerable <b>cost savings</b>.
