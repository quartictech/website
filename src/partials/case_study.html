        <h1>Case study: highway maintenance</h1>
        <h5 style="padding: 10px">
            Highway authorities in the UK are responsible for maintaining 1000's of km of paved carriageway and footway.
            Both reactive maintenance proactive resurfacing are expensive and mistakes cost <b>time</b> and <b>money</b>.
        </h5>
        <h5 style="padding: 10px">
            Quartic integrates asset databases (e.g. Pitney Bowes Confirm), visual and digital inspection data (HMDIF)
            and ad-hoc spreadsheets to give a single unified picture of road condition and maintenance work.
        </h5>
        <h5 style="padding: 10px">
            Our road-specific insights use all available data to accurately model deterioration and suggest optimal
            maintenance and treatment strategies. For example, we are able to spot opportunities for targeted resurfacing leading to considerable cost-savings.
