  Quartic Base is the core of our entire platform. It manages, cleans and integrates data, provides an analysis platform and defines your business logic all in one place.</p>
<p>
  Quartic Base is comprised of a set of tools to provide incredible flexibility with how you manage your data and analysis built after years of experience with the frustration of managing data, analysis and pipelines. We ensure you can export your data and generate events to be sent back into your organisation so our platform only helps and never hinders you.
</p>
<p>
  Quartic makes few assumptions about how you should use your data. We're designing the platform to handle simple rule based logic, through to complex machine learning algorithms. We deal with the boring aspects of data management and cleaning so you can focus on the rest.

	<h3>MgmtUI</h3>
	<p>View the status of all your datasets, live feeds and derived datasets.</p>
<p>MgmtUI provides a catalogue of all the data available in the system as well as simple metrics on the data, provenence and basic uploads and downloads.</p>
<p>
  We've engineered our software to handle almost any live data source. This means integrating new data to the system is as simple as connecting a stream to an API endpoint.
