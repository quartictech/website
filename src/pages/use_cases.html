                Quartic GroundControl is deployed within a large infrastructure services organisation. The organisation employs thousands of personnel to undertake a huge range of tasks, from collecting waste and litter to complex and safety critical maintenance work
                on national roads and railways.

            GroundControl receives data from existing asset registers, work order systems, vehicle telemetry units as well as the Quartic Remote application. 
            The system intelligently monitors and combines these datasets to achieve the following business outcomes:

            Personnel undertaking work that is dependent on speed and efficiency for profitability no longer have to manually update
            asset registers as they go about their work. Quartic Remote monitors their location and infers the assets they have
            visited on their route. These can be checked and confirmed easily at the end of their shift. Where additional evidence is
            required, personnel are prompted to take a photo or fill in a simple form which is recorded along
            with the log of work done. These data can be automatically stored to legacy asset registers, saving 1000's of hours of time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Field personnel previously had to refer to clunky work order systems and asset registers to get their job done. Quartic Remote replaces these with a single, unified view of the entire history of an asset. Previous inspections and failure reports can be used to diagnose issues. Everything is fully searchable and available seamlessly offline. As work is undertaken, engineers may attach notes, rich media content or be prompted to fill out forms or checklists. These are synced to GroundControl and may be written back to customer asset registers. Maintenance work is finished faster and better than ever before.
          </p>

<p>
  Quartic GroundControl's machine learning algorithms continuously analyse data relating to work being undertaken across the
  enterpise. Repeated, similar failure patterns are identified and turned into advice for preventative work. These are reviewed
  by senior engineers and can be quickly rolled out to field-bound personnel via Quartic Remote.
          </p>

          <p>
 Quartic GroundControl is able to make intelligent decisions about the assignment and scheduling of work. These are used
to drive savings across the business. As an example, the organisation discovered that certain parts of a town centre were
being cleansed much faster than others. Managers hypothesised that these areas might require less frequent work. Quartic
Remote was used to request a simple rating from field personnel indicating the level of work required on their route. Within
a few weeks, their responses were used to draw up a new work schedule saving 100's of hours of time.
