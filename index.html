                                <p>Every organisation has unique data and unique problems.</p>

                                <p>We start by understanding and scoping the problem with you, be it a customer
                                    retention issue or understanding how your users interact with your platform.</p>

                                <p>From the initial problem, we'll work with you to identify relevant datasets, work
                                    with users to understand how they work and work with your organisation to ensure a smooth process. We then quickly build a first
                                    draft of a solution.</p>

                                <p>From our first cut solution, we enter a tight iteration loop between your business owners, users, and
                                    our engineers, taking feedback and using it to guide the products, analyses and deployment.</p>

																<p>Finally, we deliver a reliable, effective solution to the problem whether
																	that's a massive-scale bespoke software rollout across the enterprise, or an actionable data analysis for your business.</p>
