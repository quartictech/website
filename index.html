									<h2>We believe in using the right tools and ideas for the job.</h2>
								</header>

								<p>Every data analysis company in the world claims to have the right ‘data science’ solution for ‘big data’. In practice, there’s rarely a one-size fits all — each organisation has unique data and unique problems. These require unique, bespoke solutions building off state of the art techniques, software and infrastructure.</p>

<p>At our core, we help companies use their data to further their objectives. We work on tightly scoped projects and produce tangible output, from dashboards to glean insights from your data, to one-time reports exploring a critical business question.</p>

<p>If you have a question or problem that is critical to your business we can help.</p>

<p>We start by understanding and scoping the problem with you, be it a customer retention issue or understanding how your users interact with your platform. We iterate quickly with you to produce a targeted and valuable outcome for your business.
