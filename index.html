                        <p>Founded by two former CERN physicists turned Palantir engineers, we've worked with some of the
                            largest datasets around - both
                            in academia and numerous large commercial organizations. We combine theoretical expertise
                            with hands-on real-world experience.</p>

                                <p>Every data analysis company in the world claims to have the right ‘data science’
                                    solution for ‘big data’. In practice, there’s rarely a one-size fits all — each
                                    organisation has unique data and unique problems. These require unique, bespoke
                                    solutions building off state of the art techniques, software and infrastructure.</p>


                                <p>We start by understanding and scoping the problem with you, be it a customer
                                    retention issue or understanding how your users interact with your platform.</p>

                                <p>From the initial problem, we'll work with you to identify relevant datasets, work
                                    with users to sketch out what a solution might look like and quickly build a first
                                    draft of a solution.</p>

                                <p>From our first cut solution, we enter a tight iteration loop between your users and
                                    our engineers, taking feedback and using it to guide the features we build.</p>
